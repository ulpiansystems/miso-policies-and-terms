GDPR
====

The EU [General Data Protection
Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation)
(GDPR) went into effect on May 25, 2018.

Does GDPR affect me?
--------------------

If you're based in the EU or do business in the EU, GDPR has a long reach. If
you have [any EU personal data in your Miso
account](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/key-definitions/),
such as names, email addresses, ID numbers, orâ€¦ anything personally
identifiable, then GDPR applies. You are a Controller of personal data under
GDPR, so you need to enter into GDPR-compliant data processing agreements with
any online services and third party vendors you rely on, including Miso. These
agreements are commonly called a Data Processing Addendum, or DPA.

Data Processing Addendum
------------------------

Processing EU personal data must be governed by a [GDPR-compliant
contract](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-28-gdpr/). Please [contact
us](mailto:support@miso.legal) if you want to sign a GDPR contract with us.

Subprocessors
-------------

Miso uses third party subprocessors, such as cloud computing providers and
customer support software, to provide our services. We enter into
GDPR-compliant data processing agreements with each subprocessor, and require
the same of them. [List of Miso
subprocessors](subprocessors.md).
