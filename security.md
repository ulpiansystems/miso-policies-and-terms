We protect your data.

All data is written to multiple disks instantly, backed up daily, and stored in multiple locations. Files that our customers upload are stored on servers that use modern techniques to remove bottlenecks and points of failure.

Your data is sent using HTTPS.
------------------------------

Whenever your data is in transit between you and us, everything is encrypted, and sent using HTTPS. Any files which you upload to us are stored and are encrypted at rest. Case data is also enrypted at rest. Our backups of your data are also encrypted.

Sophisticated physical security.

Our state-of-the-art servers are protected by biometric locks and round-the-clock interior and exterior surveillance monitoring. Only authorized personnel have access to the data center. 24/7/365 onsite staff provides additional protection against unauthorized entry and security breaches.

Regularly-updated infrastructure.

Our software infrastructure is updated regularly with the latest security patches. While perfect security is a moving target, we work with security researchers to keep up with the state-of-the-art in web security.
