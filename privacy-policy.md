Privacy Policy
==============

The privacy of your data - and it is your data, not ours! - is important to us.
We'll only ever access your account to help you with a problem or squash a
software bug. We'll never open any uploaded files unless you ask us to. We log
all access to all accounts by IP address, so we can always verify that no
unauthorized access has happened for as long as the logs are kept.

We're not in the business of selling our customer's private data. Any personal
data we collect will be for the purpose of operating and improving our
products.

Identity & access
-----------------

When you sign up for Miso, we ask for your name and email address. That's just
so you can personalize your new account, and we can send you updates, or other
essential information. We'll never sell your personal info to third parties,
and we won't use your name or company in marketing statements without your
permission, either.

When you write Miso with a question or to ask for help, we'll keep that
correspondence, and the email address, for future reference. We also store any
information you volunteer, like surveys, for as long as it makes sense. When
you provide your name and email on our contact form to express your interest in
Miso, we'll store those details so that we can keep in touch.

When you use Miso we will store some files on your computer so that we can
provide the services you request. This includes an identifier that can be
traced back to you and also information about how you are accessing our
services. You can read more about this in our
[cookie policy](cookie-policy.md).

The only times we'll ever share your info:

*   To provide products or services you've requested, with your permission.
    [List of third-party services we
    use](subprocessors.md).
*   To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities,
    suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical
    safety of any person, violations of our [Terms of
    Service](terms-of-service.md), or as otherwise
    required by law.
*   If Miso is acquired by or merged with another company we'll notify you
    well before any info about you is transferred and becomes subject to a
    different privacy policy.

Your Rights With Respect to Your Information
--------------------------------------------

You may have heard about the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). GDPR
gives people under its protection certain rights with respect to their personal
information collected by us on the Site. Accordingly, Miso recognizes and will
comply with GDPR and those rights, except as limited by applicable law. The
rights under GDPR include:

*   **Right of Access.** This includes your right to access the personal
    information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about
    the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.
*   **Right to Correction.** This is your right to request correction of your
    personal information.
*   **Right to Erasure.** This is your right to request, subject to certain
    limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased
    from our possession (also known as the Right to be forgotten). However, if
    applicable law requires us to comply with your request to delete your
    information, fulfillment of your request may prevent you from using Miso
    services and may result in closing your account.
*   **Right to Complain.** You have the right to make a complaint regarding our
    handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory
    authority.
*   **Right to Restrict Processing.** This is your right to request restriction
    of how and why your personal information is used or processed.
*   **Right to Object.** This is your right, in certain situations, to object
    to how or why your personal information is processed.
*   **Right to Portability.** This is your right to receive the personal
    information we have about you and the right to transmit it to another
    party.
*   **Right to not be subject to Automated Decision-Making.** This is your
    right to object and prevent any decision that could have a legal, or
    similarly significant, effect on you from being made solely based on
    automated processes. This right is limited, however, if the decision is
    necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by
    applicable European law, or is based on your explicit consent.

Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and directly updating your
account information. If you have questions about exercising these rights or
need assistance, please contact us at
[support@miso.legal](mailto:support@miso.legal).

Processors we use
-----------------

As part of the services we provide, and only to the extent necessary, we may
use certain third party processors to process some or all of your personal
information. For identification of these processors, and where they are
located, please see our [Subprocessor
listing](subprocessors.md). We have appropriate data
processing contracts that comply with GDPR with each processor.

Law enforcement
---------------

Miso won't hand your data over to law enforcement unless a court order says we
have to. We reject requests from law enforcement when they seek data without a
court order. And unless we're legally prevented from it, we'll always inform
you when such requests are made.

Security & Encryption
---------------------

All data are encrypted via
[SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) when
transmitted from our servers to your browser. The database backups are also
encrypted. Data isn't encrypted while it's live in our database (since it needs
to be ready to send to you when you need it), but we go to great lengths to
secure your data at rest. You can read more about that on our [security
page](sercurity-overview.md).

For more information about how we keep your information secure, please review
our [security overview](security-overview.md).

Deleted data
------------

When you cancel your account, we'll ensure that nothing is stored on our
servers past 30 days. Anything you delete on your account while it's active
will also be purged within 30 days.

Location of Site and Data
-------------------------

Our marketing website ([https://www.miso.legal](https://www.miso.legal)) is
operated in the USA. If you submit your email address and name via the
contact form on the website, please be aware that it will be transmitted
outside the European Union. By submitting your email address via the website,
you consent to this transfer.

The application ([https://app.miso.legal](https://app.miso.legal)) is operated
in the European Union.

Changes & questions
-------------------

Miso may update this policy once in a blue moon - we'll notify you about
significant changes by emailing you or by placing a prominent notice on our
site. You can access, change or delete your personal information at any time by
contacting [support@miso.legal](mailto:support@miso.legal).
