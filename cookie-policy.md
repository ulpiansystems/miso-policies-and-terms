Cookie Policy and Local Storage Policy
=============

Like most websites we use cookies and browser local storage to implement and
improve the services we provide to you. These are small files that we store on
your computer that your web browser can send back to us whenever it
communicates with our services.

When using these cookies and local storage values our servers will store
information about where they were sent from. This includes:

*   Your IP address
*   Browser information, such as OS, browser version

They cannot be used to track you on services outside of those provided
by Miso. They are only accessed by us or one of our subprocessors and are only
ever used in providing our services to you.

You can see our full list of subprocessors
[here](subprocessors.md).

The following sections describe what may be stored in your browser when using
Miso. For each, the name is given. Where a name is generated dynamically, _XXX_
is used to indicate the part of the name that is unkown until the cookie or
local storage value is generated.

Essential Cookies - Site Protection

also held for three days.

browser for our continuous authentication features which allows us to detect
anomolies and keep your information secure. It is stored for four hours.

### userinfo

This contains basic information about you including your name, email and userid.

### AUTHENTICATION\_TOKEN

This contains a token that is used when your browser makes a request to our
APIs. If this token is not included in request, the API will refuse to carry it
out. The token is stored when you succesfully login to Miso and is removed when
you log out.

### persist:viewer

This value adjusts the operation of the document viewer to allow you to use it
to generate facts from document annotations.
